# When will it be released?

MaiMap is currently in prototype phase. We are running it successfully against Go-based microservices and are working on getting this product ready for production usage. Once it is ready we will move on to supporting more languages like Java, TypeScript, NodeJS, Python, C# and more.

We are a team of three software engineers who initially built this product for ourselves. We find it incredibly useful in our day-to-day work but we want to hear from you as to how you would like to use this product.

**So if you haven't already, please take the time to fill out our [customer survey](/#join) form and get three months' worth of MaiMap Pro for free!**
